# WeHelp
## Abstract
There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair users. A robot with WeHelp system has two modes, idle mode and remote mode. In the idle mode, the robot follows the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. And when the wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech recognition, and then switch to the remote operation mode. In the remote operation mode, a remote human operator will take over the robot by remote control and help the wheelchair user with their needs, such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, etc. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical for wheelchair users.
